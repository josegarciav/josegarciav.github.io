I'm a Data Scientist with a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics with over 5 years of experience. 👨🏻‍💻

📚 My research interests include optimization, recommendation systems, and Bayesian modeling.

🚀 My journey into data science began after completing business school at the [Jon M. Huntsman School of Business](https://huntsman.usu.edu/), where I discovered my passion at the age of 19. Before that, I also spent some time studying civil engineering and aviation technology 🥸✈️.

Like many transitioning from a business background into data science, I am a self-taught programmer. Started with R, later migrated to Python. During my master's program, I conducted research on Weiner processes, Hamiltonian Systems, Manifold Learning, and more. For my thesis, I focused on the applications of advanced optimization algorithms on deep neural networks 👨🏻‍💻.

## More about me 🫡
🏂🏻 Activities I enjoy include rock climbing, rappelling, surfing, and deep diving in the ocean. I also have a keen interest in movies.
