<!-- ![Beach staring](/images/staring_at_the_beach.jpg){: .align-right width="300px"} -->
I'm a Data Scientist with a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics with over 5 years of experience. 👨🏻‍💻

📚 My research interests include optimization, personalization & recommendation systems, and time series modeling.

🚀 My journey into data science began after completing business school at the [Jon M. Huntsman School of Business](https://huntsman.usu.edu/), where I discovered my passion at the age of 19. Before that, I also spent some time studying civil engineering and aviation technology 🥸✈️.

I transitioned from a business background into the world data science, after which I completed a master's degree in Applied Mathematics. During my master's program, I conducted research on Weiner processes, Hamiltonian Systems, Manifold Learning, optimization, and more. For my thesis, I focused on the applications of advanced optimization algorithms on deep neural networks 👨🏻‍💻.
