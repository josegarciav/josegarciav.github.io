Education
======
<!-- * Ph.D in Mathematics and Computing, University of the Basque Country, 2026 (expected) -->
<!-- * M.S. in Modeling & Mathematical Research, Statistics and Computing, University of the Basque Country, 2024 -->
* M.S. in Applied Mathematics, Santo Domingo Institute of Technology, 2022
* B.S. in International Business & Finance, Utah State University, 2017
* B.E. in Civil Engineering (first year), Santo Domingo Institute of Technology, 2013


Work experience
======
* 2023-Present: Data Scientist, Promo
  * [AB InBev](https://www.ab-inbev.com/)
  * Duties include:
    * Design a data pipeline that takes different kinds of promotional strategies into client interface Heroku API, connecting machine learning model outputs with an RCT module, making the process of designing and releasing a promotion 3x faster.
    * Enhance the beer demand prediction module for discount optimization utilizing XGBoost, implementing a range of autoregressive variables that led to a 3% MAPE reduction, thereby optimizing forecasting accuracy.
    * I built a pipeline that measures the impact of A/B tests from model recommendations, saving the company millions by allowing it to allocate its discount budget more efficiently.
    * Consolidated and conformed growth metrics from historical promotional strategies into a single table, making the process of identifying trends from the A/B testing measures of volume uplift 5x faster.

  * Supervisor: Carlos Montero

* 2022-2023: Lead Data Scientist
  * [Santa Cruz Bank](https://bsc.com.do/home)
  * Duties included:
    * Optimized the product recommendation, machine learning feature set generation pipeline from having < 20 to > 50 variables, while also integrating insurance products into a collaborative filtering, ranking, and ensemble learning approach.
    * Built data pipeline for model monitoring metrics which included precision, recall, F1 score, coverage, and others.
    * Designed 2 additional levels to the bank customer segmentation model, which included 1) a digital channel use clustering approach and 2) a psychographic segmentation with the data generation pipeline from commerce categories.
    * I built a weekly data pipeline job that sent reports regarding client accounts in different localities to respective managers, boosting productivity 3x by eliminating manual data wrangling tasks prone to human mistakes.
    * Developed Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, including sentiment analysis, n-grams, and entity classifications, to analyze customer interaction data from the CRM system.

  * Supervisor: Persio Martinez

* 2019-2022: Data Scientist
  * [Dominican Tax Administration](https://dgii.gov.do/Paginas/default.aspx)
  * Duties included:
    * Helped build the machine learning feedback system that allowed external auditors to label taxpayers as risky or not risky.
    * Automatized the mitigation treatment data pipelines, matching risk estimations to potential preventive and corrective actions, turning the decision-making process of identifying and prioritizing tax evasive behavior 4x faster.
    * Created models such as linear regression, decision trees, and clustering.
    * Built Data Warehouse inventory, eCatalog â€“ a Shiny (R) solution that is a map of all the data infrastructure used for risk estimations (metadata, data dictionaries, data lineage), making the process of identifying data sources 5x faster.

  * Supervisor: Marhiel Diaz
