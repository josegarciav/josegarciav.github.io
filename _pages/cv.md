Education
======
<!-- * Ph.D in Mathematics and Computing, University of the Basque Country, 2026 (expected) -->
<!-- * M.S. in Modeling & Mathematical Research, Statistics and Computing, University of the Basque Country, 2024 -->
* M.S. in Applied Mathematics, Santo Domingo Institute of Technology, 2022
* B.S. in International Business & Finance, Utah State University, 2017
* B.E. in Civil Engineering (first year), Santo Domingo Institute of Technology, 2013


Work experience
======
* 2023-Present: Data Scientist, Promo
  * [AB InBev](https://www.ab-inbev.com/)
  * Duties include:
    * Designed a data pipeline to streamline promotional strategy deployment, integrating machine learning models with the client interface Heroku API, reducing promotion design and release time by 3x.
    * Improved beer demand prediction accuracy for discount optimization using XGBoost, incorporating autoregressive variables, leading to a 3% reduction in MAPE.
    * Consolidated growth metrics from historical promotions into a single Databricks table, accelerating trend identification from A/B testing volume uplift measures by 5x.
    * Designed classes to transform model outputs into combo formats for various LATAM countries.

  * Supervisor: Carlos Montero

* 2022-2023: Lead Data Scientist
  * [Santa Cruz Bank](https://bsc.com.do/home)
  * Duties included:
    * Optimized the product recommendation feature set generation pipeline, increasing the number of variables from < 20 to > 50. Integrated insurance products into collaborative filtering, ranking, and ensemble learning approach.
    * Implemented a data pipeline for monitoring model performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and coverage.
    * Enhanced the bank customer segmentation model with two additional levels:
      1. Introduced a clustering approach based on digital channel use.
      2. Incorporated psychographic segmentation using data from commerce categories.
    * Developed a weekly data pipeline job to automate the generation and distribution of client account reports to respective managers. This boosted productivity by 3x, eliminating manual data wrangling tasks and reducing human errors.
    * Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for sentiment analysis, n-grams, and entity classifications to analyze customer interaction data from the SalesForce CRM system.

  * Supervisor: Persio Martinez

* 2019-2022: Data Scientist
  * [Dominican Tax Administration](https://dgii.gov.do/Paginas/default.aspx)
  * Duties included:
    * Collaborated in developing a machine learning feedback system for external auditors to classify taxpayers as risky or not risky.
    * Automated mitigation treatment data pipelines, linking risk estimates to potential preventive and corrective actions. This accelerated the decision-making process for identifying and prioritizing tax evasion by 4x.
    * Developed various models including linear regression, decision trees, PCA, and clustering.
    * Created the Data Warehouse inventory eCatalog, a Shiny (R) solution mapping all data infrastructure used for risk estimations (metadata, data dictionaries, data lineage). This streamlined the process of identifying data sources by 5x.

  * Supervisor: Marhiel Diaz
