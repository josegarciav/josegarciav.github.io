Education
======
* M.S. in Applied Mathematics, Santo Domingo Institute of Technology, 2023
* B.S. in International Business & Finance, Utah State University, 2017
<!-- * Ph.D in Version Control Theory, GitHub University, 2018 (expected) -->

Work experience
======
* 2023-Present: Data Scientist
  * [AB InBev](https://www.ab-inbev.com/)
  * Duties included:
    * AB InBev is the largest beer brewer in the world. As a Data Scientist in the Middle Americas Zone (MAZ) Team, I work on the integration of a machine learning model for promotion optimization tailored to LATAM countries.
    * Use a machine learning approach to model product demand with a price optimization mindset. That is, search for optimal product discounts from convex demand curve splines aimed at maximizing net revenue, considering pricing strategy constraints.
    * I work on end-to-end deployments of Python data pipelines consumed by production software applications.
    * Leveraging Azure, Git, CI/CD, and DevOps practices, I've implemented advanced predictive analytics tools to enhance the beer demand prediction module, resulting in a 3% MAPE reduction. A/B testing techniques are employed to measure the model's impact in a standardized manner.
  * Supervisor: Carlos Montero

* 2022-2023: Data Scientist
  * [Santa Cruz Bank](https://bsc.com.do/home)
  * Duties included:
    * Orchestrated a product recommendation model using collaborative filtering, ensemble learning, and continuous monitoring. I mainly worked on placing this model into production and aligning outputs into the CRM (Salesforce). I also developed classification models for bank-wide customer segmentation and automated weekly report distribution, contributing to a 30% increase in productivity.
  * Supervisor: Persio Martinez

* 2019-2022: Data Specialist
  * [Dominican Tax Administration](https://dgii.gov.do/Paginas/default.aspx)
  * Duties included:
    * Worked for one of the main risk departments, responsible of assigning risk levels to taxpayers that were to be externally audited. Created risk classification levels for taxpayers using predictive modeling techniques in R. This initiative included models such as linear regression, anomaly detection models, decision trees, STAN probabilistic models (MCMC), and clustering. Additionally, in the Data Governance Project, I reduced SQL query creation times by 20% by implementing an interactive application in Shiny (R language) for metadata sharing among risk management teams.
  * Supervisor: Marhiel Diaz
