Education
======
<!-- * Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computing, University of the Basque Country, 2029 (expected) -->
* M.S. in Mathematical Modeling, Research, Statistics, and Computing, University of the Basque Country, 2025
* M.S. in Applied Mathematics, Santo Domingo Institute of Technology, 2022
* B.S. in International Business & Finance, Utah State University, 2017
* B.E. in Civil Engineering (first year), Santo Domingo Institute of Technology, 2013


Work experience
======
* 2024-Present: Advanced AI Data Trainer
  * [Invisible Technologies](https://www.invisible.co/)
  * Duties include:
    * Feed a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipeline to improve a language model in a multitude of knowledge domains, including math and programming. Employ techniques such as reward modeling (RM), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), among others.

* 2023-2024: Data Scientist, Promo
  * [AB InBev](https://www.ab-inbev.com/)
  * Duties included:
    * Worked with regional LATAM team on tuning a promotion optimization algorithm, focusing on enabling different types of promotional strategies (combos, stepped, etc.) while optimizing key metrics such as investment (discounts, reward points), boxes, ROI, coverage, and net revenue.
    * Collaborated on integrating modules to connect model outputs with client interface, which increased personalization and decreased release time of promotional campaigns by 3x.
    * Improved beer demand prediction accuracy, incorporating autoregressive variables, leading to a 3% reduction in MAPE.
    * Designed and implemented causal inference machine learning models (X-Learner, T-Learner, Synthetic DiD) to study the impact (ATT, CATE) of market innovations, enabling trend identification at the blocking factor level.

  <!-- * Supervisor: Carlos Montero -->

* 2022-2023: Lead Data Scientist
  * [Santa Cruz Bank](https://bsc.com.do/home)
  * Duties included:
    * Optimized the product recommendation feature pipeline from having < 20 to > 50 variables, into a collaborative filtering, ranking, and ensemble learning approach.
    * Enhanced the bank customer segmentation model with two additional levels:
      1. Introduced a clustering approach based on digital channel use.
      2. Incorporated psychographic segmentation using data from commerce categories.
    * Developed a weekly data pipeline job to automate the generation and distribution of client account reports. This boosted productivity by 3x, eliminating manual data wrangling tasks and reducing human errors.
    * Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for sentiment analysis, n-grams, and entity classifications to analyze customer interaction data from the Salesforce CRM system.

  <!-- * Supervisor: Persio Martinez -->

* 2019-2022: Data Scientist
  * [Dominican Tax Administration](https://dgii.gov.do/Paginas/default.aspx)
  * Duties included:
    * Collaborated in developing the analytics & machine learning feedback system to label taxpayers as risky or not risky.
    * Automated mitigation treatment data pipelines, linking risk estimates to potential preventive and corrective actions. This accelerated the decision-making process for identifying and prioritizing tax evasion by 4x.
    * Developed various models including linear regression, decision trees, PCA, and clustering.
    * Created the Data Warehouse inventory eCatalog, a Shiny (R) solution mapping all data infrastructure used for risk estimations (metadata, data dictionaries, data lineage). This streamlined the process of identifying data sources by 5x.
